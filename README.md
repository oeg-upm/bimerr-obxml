## BIMERR OBXML FILES

In [this folder](./Examples) we can see an example of an [xml file](./Examples/new.xml), in which from a series of transformations in another xml and later in a [json file](./Examples/new.json), a series of declarative mappings have been used to obtain the [RDF file](./RDF_Examples/new_obXML.ttl).



## CODE IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of the code has been carried out using the [Python language](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). Also, we have used [Helio](https://oeg-upm.github.io/helio/)) to achieve the transformation of the data by means of mappings to RDF format.
